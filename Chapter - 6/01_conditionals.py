# In python programming too, we must be able to execute instructions on a condition(s) being met.

# Whenever we write if/else/elif condition and go to next line  our cursor leaves some space which is called IDENTATION..

a = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# If else statement

if(a>18):
    print("You are above the age of consent")

else :
    print("You are below the age of consent")

print("End of program")
